// LoweredContent — the TS MIRROR of the Rust lowering IR (sheet-lower,
// spec §8.2). The Rust side serialises camelCase (serde
// rename_all="camelCase"); this file is the host-side CONTRACT for the
// already-computed output the engine hands across the wasm door. It is
// PURE DATA — zero spreadsheet semantics (CLAUDE.md hard rule: all
// Excel-like work happens in the Rust crates; this is the shape the
// translator and the panel consume).
//
// Coordinates are content-space points (pt): widths/heights and rule
// offsets are relative to the lowered region's own top-left origin. The
// translator (lower-to-mutations.ts) adds the frame's page-local bounds
// origin to place them on the page (spec §8.5 content-space principle:
// the plugin always works in frame-content coordinates).
//
// CONTRACT NOTE (Phase-2 join): the `align` value is the lowercased serde
// rendering of the Rust `Align` enum — `rename_all="camelCase"` on the
// variants yields `"general"` (the Excel default), `"left"`, `"center"`,
// `"right"`. If the Rust side ends up emitting capitalised variants, the
// Phase-2 join fixes ONE side; THIS file is the authority for the wire
// shape and the translator reads it verbatim.
